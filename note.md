# Setup
node.js / typescript skaffolding
npm install -g yo
New project: yo init

runningyo, I used yarn package manager, it is the newest and made by Facebook?

# Command
name of command is set in package.json
"command": "appsyouwear.linedance",
        "title": "linedance"
# Short-cut
Find the command using ">linedance" and give it a keybinding.
Or as I did, set it in package.json
under command and keybinding.

# import a file

- functions
- interfaces

- simple variables

# Config
package.json

tsconfig.json
